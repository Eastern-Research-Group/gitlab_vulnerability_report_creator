# gitlab_vulnerability_report_creator
Creates a standalone HTML GitLab vulnerability report using artifacts from GitLab DAST scanning tools.
  
Currently, the script relies on files generated by GitLab's DAST scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities. It doesn't directly access vulnerability data from GitLab using its GraphQL API. While we're considering adding the API approach as an option in the future, this script will continue using files for now.
  
We chose to use file based DAST results because they are guaranteed to be available during the GitLab pipeline job. In contrast, API-based results might not be fully integrated into GitLab's vulnerability repository by the time the pipeline finishes, or even several minutes afterward.

The below image shows an example output (redacted - so it doesn't show all the data).

## Usage

Note: The script is available as an image @ [easternresearchgroup/gitlab_vulnerability_report_creator - Docker Image | Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/easternresearchgroup/gitlab_vulnerability_report_creator).

**Example Running the script local with Node**: 

*node gitlab_vulnerability_report_creator.js --output {{path to report output folder}}/report.html {{path to folder}}/gitlab-dast.json {{path to folder}}/gitlab-dast-api.json*

**Note**: You can pass one or many GitLab based DAST scan result files into the script, it will combine the results into one report.
